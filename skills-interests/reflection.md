# Skills and Interests Reflection

**S**: As part of the Work Readiness Training, I was required to complete an online Skills and Interests assessment to help me understand how my values, strengths, and preferences relate to career development.

**T**: I had to read through the learning content, complete short quizzes, and submit a final assessment to test my understanding of concepts like transferable skills, values, and personal interests.

**A**: I spent time engaging with the material and reflected on how the definitions and examples related to my own life. I answered all questions carefully and submitted the assessment through the browser-based platform.

**R**: I achieved a score of 100%, which helped me confirm the skills I already have, such as communication and coding, and the interests that motivate me â€” like building apps and solving technical problems. I now feel more confident aligning my career goals with my strengths.
